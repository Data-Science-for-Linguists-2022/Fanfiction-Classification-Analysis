# Fanfiction Stylistic Analysis and Classifier

For my project, I would like to study a large data set of publically available fanfiction and analyze it for stylistic
features over a number of categories, including genre. I would also like to see if I can build a classifier to 
take unrecognized fanfiction and identify its genre. 

## Data

I plan to use data publically available on the internet, focusing on popular fanfiction sharing sites like ao3 (Archive of 
Our Own). I will write code to mine these websites, focusing on neatly categorizing stories and finding 
approximately even amounts of data in each category. I expect this web-scraping and cleaning of the data it results in to 
make up a large portion of my project.

## Analysis

I would like to come up with several stylistic points to study and compare them by genres. I would also like to build a 
classifier to categorize unseen fanfiction into genres. I hope to study how much fanfiction varies by genre and use 
statistical tests to see variation through several categories. Once I've worked out my scraping, I will have a better idea
how much I can rely on the built-in tag system on the websites I'll be using, but ideally I would be able to use those 
tags in my analysis.

## Presentation

If my classifier is a success, I would like to show that as part of my presentation. I will probably also use graphs and 
charts to show stylistic variation throughout the dataset. I will also likely present the levels of variation across 
different categories, and which were most and least helpful to me when building my classifier.
